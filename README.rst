How to run the notebooks
----------------------------------------

- **Locally on CPU**: All notebooks are stored on the github repository that also builds this website.

- **Google Colab**: If you prefer to run the notebooks on a different platform than your own coputer, or want to experiment with GPU support (assuming it is not present on your own computer), we recommend [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true).

Feedback, Questions or Contributions
----------------------------------------

This is the first time we present these tutorials during the Causality in Machine Learning course. As with any other project, small bugs and issues are expected. We appreciate any feedback from students, whether it is about a spelling mistake, implementation bug, or suggestions for improvements/additions to the notebooks.
